title: Install the Proxy CA
description: Trust TRAWL's generated root CA on operating systems, browsers, Java, and containers.

# Install the proxy CA

TRAWL decrypts proxied HTTPS connections to detect challenge pages. On first proxy startup it
creates:

- `ca.crt` — the root certificate clients install;
- `ca.key` — the private signing key, which must remain secret.

Both files live in `MITM_CA_DIR`. Per-host certificates are generated in memory and signed by
this root. Persist the directory so clients only need to install the root once.

::: danger
Anyone with `ca.key` can issue certificates trusted by clients that installed this CA. Keep the
directory private, do not publish it, and never distribute `ca.key`.
:::

## Download the certificate

The route is available when the proxy is enabled:

```bash
curl http://<trawl-host>:8191/proxy-ca.crt -o trawl-ca.crt
```

From the TRAWL container:

```bash
docker cp trawl:/data/proxy-ca/ca.crt ./trawl-ca.crt
```

## macOS

Install into the system keychain:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ./trawl-ca.crt
```

Verify or remove it:

```bash
security find-certificate -c "TRAWL MITM Proxy CA"
sudo security delete-certificate -c "TRAWL MITM Proxy CA" \
  /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

## Debian and Ubuntu

```bash
sudo cp trawl-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/trawl-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

## RHEL, Fedora, and Amazon Linux

```bash
sudo cp trawl-ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/trawl-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-trust
```

## Windows

Run PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath .\trawl-ca.crt `
  -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

Remove it later:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\Root |
  Where-Object { $_.Subject -like "*TRAWL MITM*" } |
  Remove-Item
```

## Firefox and NSS stores

Firefox installations that do not use the operating-system roots need an NSS import:

```bash
certutil -A -n "TRAWL MITM" -t "CT,C,C" -i trawl-ca.crt \
  -d sql:$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-directory>
```

Alternatively use **Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → View Certificates →
Authorities → Import**.

## Java and JDownloader

Java applications use their own `cacerts` store:

```bash
keytool -importcert -noprompt -trustcacerts \
  -alias trawl-mitm-ca \
  -file trawl-ca.crt \
  -keystore "<java-home>/lib/security/cacerts" \
  -storepass changeit
```

JDownloader bundles a JRE. Locate its active Java path in JDownloader's advanced settings, import
the certificate into that JRE's `lib/security/cacerts`, and restart JDownloader.

Prowlarr, Sonarr, and Radarr are .NET applications. Their containers normally use the Linux system
trust store, not Java `cacerts`.

## Docker clients

Mount the certificate into the client container and install it during container initialization.
For Debian-based images:

```bash
cp /config/trawl-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/trawl-ca.crt
update-ca-certificates
```

The exact startup-hook directory depends on the image. LinuxServer images support
`/custom-cont-init.d/`; other images may require a derived Dockerfile.

## Rotation and recovery

Do not delete or replace `ca.crt` or `ca.key` during normal upgrades. If either is lost, TRAWL
generates a new root on the next startup and every client must install the new certificate.

To intentionally rotate the CA:

1. stop TRAWL;
2. back up and remove both CA files;
3. start TRAWL and download the new `ca.crt`;
4. remove the old root from every client;
5. install the new root.
